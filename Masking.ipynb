        "Sometimes you want to ignore certain assets when computing pipeline expresssions. There are two common cases where ignoring assets is useful:\n",
        "1. You want to compute an expression that's computationally expensive, and you know you only care about results for certain assets. A common example of such an expensive expression is a `Factor` computing the coefficients of a regression ([RollingLinearRegressionOfReturns](https://www.quantopian.com/help#quantopian_pipeline_factors_RollingLinearRegressionOfReturns)).\n",
        "2. You want to compute an expression that performs comparisons between assets, but you only want those comparisons to be performed against a subset of all assets. For example, you might want to use the `Factor` method `top` to compute the top 200 assets by earnings yield, ignoring assets that don't meet some liquidity constraint.\n",

To do this, let's rearrange the `make_pipeline` function so that you first create the `high_dollar_volume` filter.
